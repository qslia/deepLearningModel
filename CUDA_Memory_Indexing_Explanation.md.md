Let me use the correct approach to create the markdown file by reading the current directory and then creating the file properly.

I need to create the file using a different approach. Let me provide you with the complete explanation that you can save to a markdown file:

## Explanation of `int start_pos = batch_idx * channels * spatial_size + channel_idx * spatial_size;`

This line calculates the **starting memory address** for a specific channel within a specific batch in a flattened 4D tensor. Here's the complete explanation:

### **4D Tensor Memory Layout**

Your tensor has shape `[batch_size, channels, height, width]`, but in memory it's stored as a 1D array in **row-major order**:

```
Logical 4D: [batch][channel][height][width]
Memory 1D:  [B0C0H0W0, B0C0H0W1, B0C0H1W0, B0C0H1W1, B0C1H0W0, ...]
```

### **Formula Breakdown**
```cuda
int start_pos = batch_idx * channels * spatial_size + channel_idx * spatial_size;
```

Where `spatial_size = height * width`

**Part 1: `batch_idx * channels * spatial_size`**
- Skips over all previous batches
- Each batch contains `channels * height * width` elements

**Part 2: `channel_idx * spatial_size`** 
- Skips over previous channels within the current batch
- Each channel contains `height * width` elements

### **Visual Example**
For tensor shape `[2, 3, 2, 2]` (2 batches, 3 channels, 2×2 spatial):

```
Memory indices: [0,1,2,3, 4,5,6,7, 8,9,10,11, 12,13,14,15, 16,17,18,19, 20,21,22,23]
Meaning:        [B0C0   , B0C1   , B0C2    , B1C0     , B1C1     , B1C2     ]
```

**Example calculations:**
- Batch 0, Channel 1: `start_pos = 0*3*4 + 1*4 = 4` ✓ (points to B0C1)
- Batch 1, Channel 0: `start_pos = 1*3*4 + 0*4 = 12` ✓ (points to B1C0)
- Batch 1, Channel 2: `start_pos = 1*3*4 + 2*4 = 20` ✓ (points to B1C2)

### **Usage Context**
Once we have `start_pos`, the kernel loops through all spatial locations:
```cuda
for (int i = 0; i < spatial_size; i++) {
    sum += input[start_pos + i];  // Sequential memory access
}
```

This gives us **cache-friendly sequential access** to all pixels in that specific channel, enabling efficient global average pooling computation.
