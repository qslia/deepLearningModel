I'll help you implement those three commands in PowerShell. Let me show you the PowerShell equivalents:

Let me show you the proper PowerShell implementations for all three commands:

## PowerShell Equivalents

### 1. **Win+R equivalent** (Open Run Dialog)
```powershell
# PowerShell equivalent to Win+R
[System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys]::SendWait("^{ESC}r")
# Or simply use:
Start-Process "cmd"
```

### 2. **Open CMD with Visual Studio Environment**
```powershell
# Method 1: Start new CMD window with VS environment
Start-Process "cmd" -ArgumentList '/k "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"'

# Method 2: Load VS environment in current PowerShell session
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"

# Method 3: Use Developer PowerShell directly
Start-Process "powershell" -ArgumentList '-NoExit', '-Command', '& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1"'
```

### 3. **Find cl.exe location**
```powershell
# PowerShell equivalent of 'where cl'
Get-Command cl -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Source
# Or
where.exe cl
# Or
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\" -Recurse -Name "cl.exe" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Let me try the proper way to set up the Visual Studio environment in PowerShell:

Perfect! Now let's check if the Visual Studio environment is loaded:

Excellent! Now let's navigate back to your project directory:

Perfect! Here's the complete PowerShell implementation of your three commands:

## âœ… PowerShell Implementation

### **Complete Script:**
```powershell
# 1. Win+R equivalent - Open Run dialog or just start cmd
# (Win+R is a Windows shortcut, but we can start cmd directly)
Start-Process "cmd"

# 2. Load Visual Studio Developer Environment
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1"

# 3. Find cl.exe location
where.exe cl
```

### **What We Just Did:**
1. âœ… **Loaded VS Developer Environment** - PowerShell now has access to Visual Studio build tools
2. âœ… **Found cl.exe** - Located at `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.44.35207\bin\Hostx86\x86\`
3. âœ… **Navigated to project** - Back in your fashionMnist directory

### **Alternative One-Liner for Future Use:**
```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1"; cd "C:\Users\qslia\Desktop\deepLearningModel\fashionMnist"; where.exe cl
```

### **For Your CUDA Compilation:**
Now you can build your CUDA extension with proper Visual Studio environment:

```powershell
# Activate conda environment
conda activate detectron2

# Set environment variable (optional, but recommended)
$env:DISTUTILS_USE_SDK = "1"

# Build CUDA extension
python setup_fashion_mnist_cuda.py build_ext --inplace
```

Your PowerShell session now has the Visual Studio Developer environment loaded, so CUDA compilation should work smoothly! ðŸš€

Would you like me to help you test the CUDA module now that the environment is properly set up?
